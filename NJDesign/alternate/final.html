		<h1>Alternate Builds of Speed Champions Cars: Final Details for a Speed Champions Alternate</h1>
		<div class="author">By <a href="https://rebrickable.com/NJDesign">NJDesign</a></div>
		<div class="description"><a href="https://rebrickable.com/users/NJDesign/">NJDesign</a> explains how to make a good MOC description as well as handle user interactions.</div>
		<div class="date">Published: August 4, 2025</div>
		<p>
			As far as the MOC's description goes, try to include as many details, pros, and cons about the model as you can. Be as honest and transparent with the potential customer as possible. Hide nothing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Last but not least, remain polite and professional with any customers who complain or need help, and be more than happy to right any wrongs you may accidentally make.
